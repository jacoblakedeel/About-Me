    <p><h4>My name is Jacob Lake Deel. I am 31 and I hail from Atlanta, Georgia. <br/>
      I am an avid rock climber and musician. My musical group <a href="http://thepleasurepoint.bandcamp.com"> The Pleasure Point </a> <br/>
      has been my main creative focus for about 5 years.<br/>
      Prior to Covid I had always worked in the food service industry.<br/>
      This new world has given me an opportunity to reconsider my career path and create a <br/>
      new future for myself. I am excited to pursue an education in full-stack development <br/>
      with DigitalCrafts!
